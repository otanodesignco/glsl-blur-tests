# KitchenSink Framework

react three fiber(r3f) framework with ports from shadergraph nodes utilized by the unity game engine. Each node is provided as either a single function with overloads or a family of functions. Some functions do require specific transformations between coordinate spaces and a sample vertex for parallax mapping is provided. This framework is not complete and is currently being developed.
